macOS Artifact Parsing Tool

mac_apt is a DFIR tool to process Mac computer full disk images (**or _live_ machines**) and extract data/metadata useful for forensic investigation. It is a python based framework, which has plugins to process individual artifacts (such as Safari internet history, Network interfaces, Recently accessed files & volumes, ..)

#### Project Status: _BETA_
#### Requirements: Python 3.7 (32/64 bit)

#### Features:
* Cross platform (no dependency on pyobjc)
* Works on E01, VMDK, DD, split-DD, DMG (no compression) & mounted images (good for nix, limited support on windows)
* XLSX, CSV, Sqlite outputs
* Analyzed files/artifacts are exported for later review
* zlib, lzvn, lzfse compressed files are supported!
* Native HFS & APFS parser
* Reads the Spotlight database and Unified Logging (tracev3) files
