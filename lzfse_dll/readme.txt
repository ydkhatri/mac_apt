This pyd (dll) file should be placed into your python installation folder under 
\Lib\site-packages\

lzfse.pyd has been compiled using Visual Studio 2012 as a 32-bit DLL for use with
python 2.7 .

This is a fork of the pylzfse project (https://github/com/dimkr/pylzfse) with 
a few modifications to work with the compression parameters used in macOS. That 
project in turn depends on Apple's reference implementation of lzvn/lzfse available
at https://github.com/lzfse/lzfse.
